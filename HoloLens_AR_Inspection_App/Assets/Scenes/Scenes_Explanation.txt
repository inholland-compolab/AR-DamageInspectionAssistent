In the first HoloLens 1 version, each mode had its own scene. This was an great solution to keep a clear overview of all menus and windows within that scene.

Then the app needed adjustments to run on the HoloLens 2. The HoloLens 2 is a more advanced device and provides a better experience. However, the HoloLens 2 needs a specific structured scene manager (MRTK provides such a scene manager). Because a simple scene manager was used, the HoloLens 2 version of the app crashed a lot when switching between scenes.

To avoid this, the menus and windows are placed in a prefab. These prefabs can be spawned, destroyed, activated or deactivated. Due to limited programming time, this was an easier solution than the special scene manager.

Converting the scenes to prefabs resulted into changes within the scripts and references. Because some buttons and scripts are in a prefab, it is not always possible to refer to them. This is solved by relocating some functions and search for a certain gameobject within the Unity Hierarchy tree.
